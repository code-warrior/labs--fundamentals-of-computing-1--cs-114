## 1. A Table of Student Grades

Write a Java program that prints a table with a list of at least 5 students together with their grades earned (lab points, bonus points, and the total) in the format below.

```bash
///////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
==          Student Points          ==
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\///////////////////

Name        Lab       Bonus    Total
----        ---       -----    -----
Joe         43        7        50
William     50        8        58
Mary Sue    39        10       49
```

The requirements for the program are as follows:

1. Save `StudentGrades.java` to a local directory. Compile and run it to see that it works.
2. Print the border on the top as illustrated (using the forward slash and back slash characters).
3. Use tab characters to get your columns aligned, and use the + operator both for addition and string concatenation.
4. Make up your own student names and points — the ones shown are just for illustration purposes. You need 5 names in total, including the ones already provided.

## 2. Painting a Room

File `Paint.java` contains a partial program, which, when complete, will calculate the amount of paint needed to paint the walls of a room of the given length and width. It assumes that the paint covers 350 square feet per gallon.

1. Save `Paint.java` to a local directory. Compile and run it to see that it works.
2. Fill in the missing statements (the comments tell you where to fill in) so that the program does what it is supposed to. Compile and run the program and correct any errors.
3. Suppose the room has doors and windows that don't need painting. Ask the user to enter the number of doors and number of windows in the room, and adjust the total square feet to be painted accordingly. Assume that each door is 20 square feet and each window is 15 square feet.
