## 1. Rolling Dice

Write a complete Java program that simulates the rolling of a pair of dice. (Use the enclosed `Dice.java` program to start.) For each die in the pair, the program should generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive). It should print out the result of the roll for each die and the total roll (the sum of the two dice), all appropriately labeled. You must use the `Random` class. The `RandomNumbers` program in listing 3.2 of the text may be helpful.

## 2. Computing Distance

The file `Distance.java` contains an incomplete program to compute the distance between two points. Recall that the distance between the two points (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) is computed by taking the square root of the quantity `(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2`. The program already has code to get the two points as input. You need to add an assignment statement to compute the distance and then a print statement to print it out (appropriately labeled). Test your program using the following data:

```bash
The distance between the points (3, 17) and (8, 10) is 8.6023... (lots more digits printed); the distance between (-33,49) and (-9, -15) is 68.352...
```
